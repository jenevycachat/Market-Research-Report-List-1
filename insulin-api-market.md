<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin API Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Regular Human Insulin</li><li>Insulin Analogue</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Insulin API market is divided into two main types: Regular Human Insulin and Insulin Analogues. Regular Human Insulin mimics the natural insulin produced by the pancreas, providing a straightforward option for managing diabetes. In contrast, Insulin Analogues are synthesized to have modified structures, allowing for faster or prolonged absorption, which offers greater flexibility and improved blood sugar control. Both types cater to diverse patient needs, from basic management to advanced therapy, enhancing treatment outcomes in diabetes care.</p></p>

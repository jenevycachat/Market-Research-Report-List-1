<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DNA Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recombinant Protein Vaccine</li><li>Gene-Based Vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The DNA vaccines market is primarily categorized into recombinant protein vaccines and gene-based vaccines. Recombinant protein vaccines involve the introduction of specific proteins from a pathogen to stimulate an immune response, often leading to the production of antibodies without using live pathogens. In contrast, gene-based vaccines employ genetic material to instruct cells to produce antigens, eliciting a more direct immune response. Both types enhance immunogenicity, offering innovative strategies for disease prevention, particularly in emerging infectious diseases and cancer therapies.</p></p>
